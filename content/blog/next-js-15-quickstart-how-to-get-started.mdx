If you're a web developer, chances are you've heard of React â€“ the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React has revolutionized the way we build web applications, making it easier and more efficient to create dynamic, interactive experiences.

But while React is great for building client-side applications, it's not optimized for server-side rendering (SSR). That's where Next.js comes in.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a server-side rendering framework for React that enables you to build web applications that render both on the server and the client. SSR has many benefits, including faster page load times, improved SEO, and better accessibility.

Next.js also includes other features that make building React applications easier, such as automatic code splitting, static site generation, and dynamic imports. This means you can focus on building your application without having to worry about performance or infrastructure.

## Benefits of Next.js

### Improved Performance

One of the biggest benefits of using Next.js is improved performance. Because Next.js renders your pages on the server, users can see the content of your page more quickly. This leads to a better user experience and can even improve your search engine rankings.

### SEO Optimization

Another benefit of using Next.js is improved SEO. Because Next.js pre-renders your pages on the server, search engines can crawl your site more easily. This means that your pages are more likely to be indexed and appear higher in search results.

### Easy Deployment

Next.js makes it easy to deploy your application to production. You can use popular hosting services like Vercel or deploy to your own infrastructure. Next.js is also compatible with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins or CircleCI.

## Getting Started with Next.js 15

Thankfully for the team at Vercel, getting started is easy. First, you'll need to install Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager). Then, you can install Next.js using npm or your favorite package manager. I recommend using npm for beginners as it's the most widely used package manager for Node.js projects.

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```
